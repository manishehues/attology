<h2 class="Oswald">The Hard Facts</h2>



<p class="subText">Research shows that top shops generate $247,000 greater sales per machine and $60,000 greater sales per employee. How do they do this? Believe it or not, the top reasons for their 5-6% higher machine utilization are NOT machine related—rather the result of a variety of worker related issues— like how they interact with the machines they’re operating. Most shops can’t automatically capture data around these interactions, therefore their operational analytics don’t tell a complete story or lead to any viable utilization improvements.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to eliminate a problem when there’s a lag between the time a problem occurs and the time it takes to discover and fix the problem.</p>
<p>This becomes further complicated when when multiple problems occur in various locations creating an exponential factor of operational inefficiency. On top of that, the issues aren’t always noticeable to managers even though they happen right in front of their eyes.</p>
